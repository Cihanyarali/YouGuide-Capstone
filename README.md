# YouGuide-Capstone

YouGuide
This project aims to create a map application where users can search for locations, get optimized routes, and save custom markers for better exploration and planning.
Core Features:
1.	Search Functionality:
Users can search for locations, addresses, or points of interest.
2.	Interactive Map:
A dynamic map where users can zoom, pan, and explore areas visually using Geolocation API 
3.	Custom Markers:
Users can create and save custom markers on the map, with labels and notes for specific locations.
4.	Route Navigation:
Provides optimized routes for driving, walking, or cycling, including travel times and distances.
5.	Mobile Responsiveness:
A design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
6.	Dark Mode:
A design for the night times.(Maybe)
User Based:
•	I want it to be used  search for specific locations to plan my trips effectively.
•	Goingt to add  save and label custom locations for quick access in the future.
•	I want an app that works smoothly on both my phone and desktop.(React Native in the future)
Technical Stack:
•	Frontend: React.js for the user interface, Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling, React Router for navigation.
•	Map Integration: Geolocation API for map rendering, search, and route calculations.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview
•	Version Control: GitHub for tracking progress and incremental updates.
Optional Features:
1.	Offline Access: Allow users to download map sections for offline use.
2.	Geofencing Notifications: Notify users when entering or exiting predefined areas.
3.	Map Customization: Provide different themes like dark mode, satellite view, or terrain view.
Next Steps:
1.	 Implement the search functionality for locations and points of interest. (Trip advisor)
2.	Add features to allow users to save and manage custom markers.
3.	Test the app on different devices and iterate based on feedback.
4.	Document all sources, APIs, and progress in the README file.
5.	Turning the Project to a mobile app with React Native also .
